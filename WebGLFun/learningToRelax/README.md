Just a weekend-ish project to play around with webgl.

I wanted to see if I could recreate the core of the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtjS3KN162s) for Dan Deacon's "Learning to Relax" from scratch,

He's super good, check him out:
[his sound cloud](https://soundcloud.com/dan-deacon), [his personal website](https://dandeacon.com/#music)

It's just a short "proof of concept", not intended to faithfully recreate the exact video.
Check out a [live version](https://ianstranathan.com/projects/justForFun/learningToRelax/index.html) on my personal website.
